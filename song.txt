Just pay attention
Here's a story bout my lil' homies, straight thuggin'
Lil' bad young mothafuckers, gotta love him
You could catch him in his G ride, touchin' his glock
Screamin outlaw bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin money makin' dummies out the police, ain't no peace
For an adolescent nigga to rap, so be a thinker
Bud smokin' twenty-four seven, everyday drinker

Got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder fool
Always the young niggaz gettin' in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin motherfuckers
