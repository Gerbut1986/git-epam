Just pay attention
Here's a story bout my lil' homies, straight thuggin'
Lil' bad young mothafuckers, gotta love him
You could catch him in his G ride, touchin' his glock
Screamin outlaw bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin money makin' dummies out the police, ain't no peace
For an adolescent nigga to rap, so be a thinker
Bud smokin' twenty-four seven, everyday drinker
